# README

The purpose of this application is to provide an environment for potential users who want to engage in online discussions without the burden of having to create an account and silencing themselves on particular matters due to the prevalence of prying eyes in our world. It is "finished" in that it accomplishes what it sets out to do, that is, allow people to speak anonymously. Certain features such as a search function and true account verification (if you want to create an account) are coming in the very near future.

As the application is currently not deployed to heroku just yet, here are the steps to get the application up and running yourself. You will need to:

1. Install Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
2. Download the application's zip file.
3. Unzip the file in a directory of your choosing.
4. Navigate to the directory in the Terminal/Command Line.
5. Open up a local server using the command 'rails server'. The address has already been configured in the application.
6. Open up your preferred browser and type "localhost:3000" into the address bar.
7. Explore the application/website as you wish.

Users can create topics and comments on topics with no account creation necessary. There is a gem in place that detects and filters out spam from bots, so security is not too great of an issue. In the (very, very, very) near future the ability to delete topics and comments without having to venture into the Command Line/Terminal will be implemented.

Below is a gallery of what the application looks like in action. Feel free to download, style and reupload into your own repository as you see fit.
