/*NOTICE: I would have created more .css files, but the paths "weren't found".
So, I will have to do the dirty job that was done with the blog app, only
this time the ante will be upped because the project is much more complex.

As such, the CSS file will be divided into parts. If a style goes to a
particular file, find that file with Cmmd+F and find the styles there. I don't
like it, but that's how things are going to be for right now.*/


/*These two elements are incredibly glitchy and I cannot explain why. Deleting
the one on the bottom gets rid of the website's background color and deleting
the top one displays the username on comments even though it is in the topic
file. This is some of the most broken code I have ever witnessed, and that is
saying a lot. Erase at your own risk.*/
